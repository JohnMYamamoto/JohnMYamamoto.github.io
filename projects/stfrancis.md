In this project, my team organized and volunteered in reoccuring volunteer days at St. Francis hospital where we worked on various tasks such as creating hospice information folders for patients, putting together gift baskets and care packages, etc. We sought to involve other students in the project so we recruited many of our classmates to volunteer to so that they could not only help out the hospital, but also grow as people from doing work that benefitted the hospital.
