I have been skateboarding for over four years now, and a couple of years ago when I started to progress a lot, I decided to create a skate video of myself. I spend a lot of time watching professional skate videos, and one of my long-time hobbies is video production, so it felt like a natural project to me. I biked and drove to spots around my town and outside of it, and I would ask my friends and family to film me when they could, and I would use a stand to hold my camera when I just wanted to film by myself. After a year of filming and a lot of falling, I had all of the clips that I needed to make my video. I used Apple's IMovie software to edit the video, and when it was done I finally had a full-length skate video of my own.
