In this project, my friends and I would go after school to Oahu's downtown area with a cooler filled with cold sodas and a bunch of pizza boxes and pass out food and share a kind word when possible. Our goal was to alleviate the hunger that homeless people face, to spread the love of God, and to treat the homeless people kindly because it's important for people to be treated kindly and to know that they are worth being treated well. We also did this work for our own good as well, as the experience helped us gain greater empathy for other people and also taught us how to give to others without seeking return.
