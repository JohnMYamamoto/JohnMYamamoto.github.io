In this project, my friends and I would go after school to Oahu's downtown area with a cooler filled with cold sodas and a bunch of pizza boxes and pass out food and share a kind word when possible. We would also try to pray for people when the opportunity would arise. Our goal was to alleviate the hunger that homeless people face and to treat them kindly to help restore to them a bit of their humanity. We also did this work for our own good as well, as the experience helped us gain greater empathy for other people and also taught us how to give to others without seeking return.
