I am constantly challenged and inspired by the way that different systems are engineered throughout the world. One example is the intricately designed nutrient chain in the Palmyra Atoll where every participant in the chain is key from the fish to the birds to the trees to the plankton and where each link complements the next perfectly. Another example is the Oahu Wastewater Treatment plant where the automation technology is designed and planned down to the smallest detail or potential situation that could arise. I think that software engineering is a highly interesting field that produces impactful systems which touch upon all aspects of life. The design and maintenance that makes these systems possible is all built upon the principles of engineering. 

I am new to the field of software engineering and one of the first things I would like to learn is the skill of desiging a software that has many components that come together to produce a cohesive project. So far, I have mostly only written programs in Java. I know how to make different classes and methods work together, so I suppose that is a start, but I am moving in the direction of using multiple languages and tools to build software. I believe that I will learn how to do this in my current class, ICS 314 at UH Manoa. I am excited to learn how to build a cohesive and multifaceted project. 

Another key part of engineering is the maintainenance of software, which I know nothing about. I hope to gain the experience of maintaining software. I would like to learn how to create and test patches, and adapt my software to changes in the security field as well as updating features to make my software more efficient and user friendly. One type of software that I am interested in learning how to engineer is software that interacts with hardware of some sort. It would be interesting to design and maintain a software that ran automations for some sort of hardware, like the one at the Oahu Wastewater Treatment plants. 

While I am new to the field of software engineering, I am excited to learn every aspect of it with hopes that I can someday put my software engineering skills to use in the real world to design an effective and cohesive system.
