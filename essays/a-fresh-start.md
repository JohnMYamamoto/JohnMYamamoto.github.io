P1: My interest in design

As far back as I can remember, I have always been facinated by systems of design. Growing up, I was interested in a career as a marine biologist and one of the things that really attracted me to the field was this idea of marine ecosystems and how all components work together to form a cohesive narrative. Now as an adult, I find myself interested in systems of code, softwares that are built up of many different parts to serve a role or to complete a task. I enjoy programming, and this idea of developing software with the engineering approach of planning, building, and maintaining/innovating coding projects with multiple parts is very attractive to me, as it is the process of building these efficient systems that I am so interested in. 

P2: Skills I hope to gain
Through the class I am currently taking, ICS 314 Software Engineering, I hope to gain a clear understanding of software engineering and everything that goes into it. I want to have the ability to thoroughly explain what the field of software engineering is about to someone who has no experience with it. Beyond that, I want to be competent in software engineering. This is a goal that goes beyond the class, but starts here. I hope to achieve proficiency in languages like Typescript and SQL and become comfortable with frameworks such as React and Next.js. Additionally, I 

that I can use in engineering software such as proficiency in languages like Typescript and frameworks like React and skills with databases and other forms of backend development. 

P3: Experiences I hope to have
