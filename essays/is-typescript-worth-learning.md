What do you think about Typescript so far? If you’re a complete newbie, how does it compare to other programming languages that you know? If you have prior experience, did you learn new things from this module, perhaps with respect to ES6? Do you think Typescript is a good or bad programming language from a software engineering perspective?

What about athletic software engineering? Did you find the practice WODs to be useful? What do you think about this style of learning? Is it stressful? Is it enjoyable? Do you think it will work for you?

P1: My experience with TS so far
I am quite new to Typescript. My experience is unique in that I actually took a month of the course I am taking right now, ICS 314 at UH Manoa last semester, but dropped out because of mental health reasons. So I have about a month's worth of ICS 314 Typescript/Javascript experience from this class and nothing before that. From what I have seen so far, Typescript is a great language. I think that it is not only an effective language for building the front-end side of web applications, but also very useful for backend, mobile app, and desktop development. Typescript can be used in a plethora of ways. There are a lot of frameworks for it such as React and Next.js, and it is very compatible with Javascript code, so developers don't have to make a huge leap from JS to TS, but can make a gradual transition over instead. The widesperead usage of Typescript makes it easy to find resources for it, and the type safety that it provides only improves Javascript code in my opinion. I am a proponent of Typescript. 

P2: My hopes for TS in the future
-I hope to work on a front-end project in TS 
-I hope to experience using Typescript in different areas such as back end and desktop development
-I hope to become competent in Typescript so that I can potentially use it in my career someday
