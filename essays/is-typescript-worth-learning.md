A week ago, for the first time ever, I learned what Typescript is. I am taking a Software Engineering class at UH Manoa and I am required to use Typescript (a superset of Javascript) to program. I am fairly new to computer science, and my only experience is in Java. In this essay, I am going to compare TypeScript to Java, give some thoughts on the language, and talk a little bit about a pedagogy called Athletic Software Engineering. 

First off, I feel like Typescript actually isn't that different from Java. Becuase they are both object oriented, it feels to me as if both function in the same way, just perhaps used for slighly different purposes. 

From a programming perspective, I feel like Typescript is an efficient language to write once one gets the hang of it, and has many uses in software development. It is fair to say that Typescript is more tedious to write compared to Javascript due to static typing, but the time that static typing saves in the debugging process more than makes up for the miniscule bit of tedium in writing types into one's code. Typescript is a very capable language for web application because its type casting allows for easier readability for collaboration as well as better maintainability for large scale application development. Additionally, Typescript has a large community that offers a lot of support for the language, and it works well with popular frameworks such as react and Express.js.

In my Software Engineering class, we were introduced to a pedagogy called athletic software engineering. It compares software engineering to sports, which have specific skills to learn and muscles to build. In this pedagogy, it is believed that certain "skills" and "muscles" can be developed through skill-specific exercises called "workouts." I believe that athletic SE is a great way to become a better software developer. When engineering software, there are a million different ways one can go about how to do it. However, some ways are better than others. Workouts allow software engineers to build habits and skills that will allow them to efficiently and confidently design software to the best of their ability. Again, this ties to the concept of sports, where working out the proper technique will allow one to play their sport much better than just playing in whatever way they feel like. In conclusion, I am a big supporter of athletic software engineering and I am glad that I am learning it in my class.
