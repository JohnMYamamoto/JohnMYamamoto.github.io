Often the quality of an answer originates from the quality of the question being answered. Anyone can relate to the sting of a blunt response to a poorly   formed question. "Are you even trying?," our peers sometimes ask us when we are careless with our inquiries. Well, the first step to asking good questions is to try, and the second step is to have a well-thought-out strategy to asking good questions. 

<h2>Forming a strategy</h2>
After reading "How to ask questions the smart way" by Eric Raymond and done some thinking of my own, I have come up with some pieces of advice to keep in mind while asking smart questions particularly in open-source communities. The first piece of advice is to try to solve your problem on your own first. From what I have seen, people typically prefer to help people who are already trying to help themselves. Try to come up with different solutions to your problem and do some quick google searches to see if there are any resources that might provide an already-written answer to your question. Additionally, AI is a great resource for asking questions as well. Asking an AI might be more efficient than scouring the internet for answers yourself, and there's less pressure to ask perfect questions too! My second piece of advice, once you have put some work into your problem, is to include the details of what you have tried already in your question. Include the solutions you have tried, and explain in detail the roadblocks you have encountered. Including detailed information about your question makes it more appealing and easier to answer, and it might just be the difference between getting an answer and getting ignored because your question isn't interesting enough. My final piece of advice, is to be polite and considerate when asking your question. Don't just paste your code into the forum and expect other people to figure the problem out by themselves; do the work and dissect the code and problem yourself, and make it easy for your answerer to understand exactly what you are asking. When you are asking for help, ask in a polite and professional manner. When you get an answer, don't forget to thank the person who helped you.

<h2>An example from Stack Overflow</h2>
An example of what I consider a smart question was asked by Asad Zaman on Stack Overflow. A link to the question is provided <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79401224/should-i-use-next-js-or-only-react-for-a-mern-stack-application">here</a>. His question was "Should I use Next.js or Only React for a MERN Stack Application?" Asad started by explaining that he is building a MERN stack application and is considering using Next.js for the frontend. He then shared some challenges that he is facing as a beginner. In his question, Asad also includes that he has started to build his application and has tried to set up API routes in Next.js and some other things that he has tried. Asad finishes his question by asking his question in detail: "I want to know whether Next.js is a suitable choice for a MERN stack application or if it's better to use React without Next.js." Asad's question generated a positive and helpful response by Kris Rice. Kris started his response by sympathizing with Asad by sharing his own experience as a beginner with Reach and Next.js. He shared his thoughts on Next.js and that he reccomends using it. He then clarifies his answer with some qualifications for his response, and that using Next.js purely as a backend depends on the requirements.
