    Often the quality of an answer originates from the quality of the question being answered. Anyone can relate to the sting of a blunt response to a poorly   formed question. "Are you even trying?," our peers sometimes ask us when we are careless with our inquiries. Well, the first step to asking good questions is to try, and the second step is to have a well-thought-out strategy to asking good questions.

  <h2>What constitutes a smart question?</h2>
After reading "How to ask questions the smart way" by Eric Raymond and done some thinking of my own, I have come up with some pieces of advice to keep in mind while asking smart questions particularly in open-source communities. The first piece of advice is to try to solve your problem on your own first. From what I have seen, people typically prefer to help people who are already trying to help themselves. Try to come up with different solutions to your problem and do some quick google searches to see if there are any resources that might provide an already-written answer to your question. Additionally, AI is a great resource for asking questions as well. Asking an AI might be more efficient than scouring the internet for answers yourself, and there's less pressure to ask perfect questions too!


My second piece of advice, once you have put some work into your problem, is to include the details of what you have tried already in your question. Include the solutions you have tried, and explain in detail the roadblocks you have encountered. Including detailed information about your question makes it more appealing and easier to answer, and it might just be the difference between getting an answer and getting ignored because your question isn't interesting enough. 

My final piece of advice, is to be polite and considerate when asking your question. Don't just paste your code into the forum and expect other people to figure the problem out by themselves; do the work and dissect the code and problem yourself, and make it easy for your answerer to understand exactly what you are asking. When you are asking for help, ask in a polite and professional manner. When you get an answer, don't forget to thank the person who helped you.
