Paragraph 1: Why smart questions are important
Often the quality of an answer originates from the quality of the question being answered. Anyone can relate to asking an obvious or unrelated question in school and recieving a sigh from their teacher paired with the response question of "Are you even paying attention in this class young woman/man"? 
Paragraph 2: What constitutes a smart question?

Paragraph 3 & 4: The questions and how they do or don't fill the precepts for smart questions

Paragraph 5: How the responses reflect the questions

Paragraph 6: My insights from this experience
