## Like a (seemingly) Nagging Parent
Have you ever felt like your parents are trying to micromanage your life? Maybe you believed that you knew what you were doing, and your parents' suggestions to not wear those baggy jeans in 89 degree weather felt offensive and counter productive to your happiness. Coding standards and extensions like ESLint can sometimes feel like your nagging parents. Even though your code looks fine to you, ESLint wants you to put in the extra work of doing stuff like putting spaces between the elements in your array or using single quotes for strings. With both your parents and ESLint, you might not understand at first why they say what they say. However, as you step outside of your house and begin to feel the heat on your skin, you realize that your parents were just trying to help, and that their suggestions would've come in handy had you listened. In the same way, I believe that coding standards and ESLint provide helpful suggestions that lead to better code and overall improved efficiency. 

## My Experience With ESLint
I have been using ESLint to correct my TypeScript code for about a week now, and my impression is that it is constructive to my programming. To my surprise, coding standards has actually helped me to learn TypeScript as I am new to it, because it lets me know what I can and cannot do in the language. After a couple years of coding in Java, I am still not used to TypeScript's syntax, but when I screw up, ESLint kindly lets me know with a fiery red squiggly line under my code telling me what I am doing wrong. 

ESLint makes it easier for me to write good code, as it automates the task of looking for bugs and also code style errors for me. It allows me to focus on thinking more of the logic of my code, instead of spending precious brain cells on what types I need to assign to my methods. Some people feel like ESlint creates extra work by providing extra errors to sort through, but I feel like catching those errors early allows programmers to save time and ultimately write better code. The goal is always to write better code, and ESLint assists with that goal wonderfully.
